My project is a NGO project that is involved through helping the community through a business, it goes by the name of TheDoughnutLoft, it's a bakery business that was founded in 2025 by Omolemo Modise. It started as a school project that turned into a successful dream.
The Project was created using Vscode and sources like W3 Schools. The Project faced challenges like using correct meta-keywords and correct file structuring.
The project can be viewed through any web browser or through applications that support html viewing.
